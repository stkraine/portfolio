                    ## The super-capacitor powered go-kart
                    ***
                    ### Motivation
                    As I learned more about electronics and electrical systems through robotics and my other activities,
                    I began to explore
                    the idea of an electric go-kart. The project really began when I found an old washing machine motor
                    in a barn and wanted to make something that I could
                    ride on. Basically, I strapped the motor on to a very thin sheet of plywood that bent under the
                    weight of the motor. That was the beginning of the Saggin' Waggin'!

                        Saggin' Waggin' v1.0 had many issues:
                        - It was quite flimsy. to the point where sitting on it made me nervous it would break.
                        - There was no steering... I mean at all, and I was not intending to make a drag strig go-kart.
                        - The washing machine motor required an extension cord to run as I did not have a battery or
                        inverter on the go-kart.
                    ### V2.0 The Gas Edition
                    The findings from this first iteration led to Saggin' Waggin' v2.0. The second iteration of the
                    project became a very quick, but also slow success. I rebuilt the frame to
                    be triangular and actually have sterring components, albeit just a board that I would grab on to and
                    push around to steer. As you can see from the image, the gas go-kart motor that I added gave me some
                    more power and
                    wasn't tethered to the wall. This led to something that I could ride around on and wouldn't be too
                    precarious.

                        As expected, Saggin' Waggin' v2.0 had some issues as well:
                        - I didn't love the gas engine.
                        - The top speed wasn't very high.
                        - the clutch would slip constantly and it was difficult to start because it was designed for a
                        smaller go-kart.</md-block>

                    ### V3.0 The return of the charge!
                    After V2.0, I set the project aside as I became displeased with the gas propulsion system and was
                    short on funds for a larger engine. However,
                    As I got older, my knowlege of electrical propulsion systems expanded and I discovered the
                    super-capacitor. This rabbit-hole adventure turned into
                    a facination with making a quick-charging, rideable go-kart. Armed with my first co-ops earnings, I
                    revisited the waggin'...

                    I decided to take a risk on some claimed super-capacitors from Alibaba.com and was pleasantly
                    surprised! I assembled 24 of these capacitors into a small array
                    that was much more powerful in retrospect than I ever realised. I also have a facination with BLDC
                    motors as well and so I took the largest BLDC I could find, paired with a VESC controller,
                    and put that onto yet a third frame! I paired this with a radio control throttle and was able to
                    ride it! The extra torque from the electric drive train, paired with a large sprocket allowed me to
                    ride around with a comfortable max speed.
                    For being powered by a super-capacitors, I expected a runtime less than five minutes, but was able
                    to ride it for close to 30 minutes! And then was able to charge the capacitor bank from a power
                    supply in 15 minutes. To me that
                    was a huge win!

                        Saggin' Waggin' V3.0 was a win in a lot of areas:
                        - New frame that had rigid metal beams.
                        - Electric drive trane with torque to keep me moving and could climb hills.
                        - Long run time.
                        - Quick charge time.

                        But also a loss in some areas as well:
                        - More precarious steering.
                        - 3D printed mounts that would break under high stress.</md-block>

                    ### Conclusion
                    The Saggin' Waggin' was a fun project for me to work on in high school and early in my college
                    career. I do eventually want to revisit the project from
                    the mechanical side as, very well shown, that is the most lacking area of the prototype. I would
                    love to see a welded metal frame that has the capacitor bank built in to it.
                    Additionally, would love to see an autonomous robot that would actually have a task with automatic
                    recharging as well!
