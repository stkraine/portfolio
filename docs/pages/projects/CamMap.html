                    ## CamMap: an app for mapping a commute
                    ***
                    This has become my latest project as of now. I want to make an HD map of my commute to and from school. In order to do this 
                    I plan on using my phone camera to capture images and the GPS within my phone to get a general location. From there, the data can be sent to 
                    a remote server (at my house) that can start to construct the map. My hope is that with more and more commutes, I will be able to start accounting
                    for the lack of accuracy within my phone's GPS. What I have envisioned in my head is a graph optimisation problem that does two things:
                    ***
                    - First, it will create a single map for the single commute
                    - Second, the server will merge the single map into the existing full-scale map to create a single, well constructed, HD map. 
                    ***
                    My plan is to use the LightGlue algorithm for finding the relationship between different images. Additionally, I hope that the architecture will prove to be
                    a lightweight application on the phone, while keeping most of the computation on a "remote" server.

                    This project is proving to be very challenging for me as I am not an android developer... yet. I have started 
                    to work with Android Studio for designing the app, however, that is still in its infincy.
