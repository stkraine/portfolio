                    ## My CNC Machine
                    ***
                    ### Motivation
                    I am forever the tinkerer, and I love to buy tools and expand my ability to accomplish things on my own. This has sparked a small journey of mine to 
                    automate the manufacturing of small products through CNC technology. I first started by making my own design from scratch but quickly moved away from that 
                    because of the accuracy that I was able to achieve not being that great. You can see some of the initial results in the image below:

                <div class="text-center">
                    <img src="/images/CNC_1.jpg" , alt="CNC_test" , class="image_center">
                    Test cut on home-made CNC machine.
                </div>
                    
                <md-block>
                
                    This machine certainly had some drawbacks:
                    - Poor construction tolerences
                    - Innacurate cutting precision
                    - Slow movements

                I realized that I didn't want to spend my time working on making a machine and would rather make things with my machine, so I decided to purchase a DIY kit that would solve all my problems
                from the homemade one. Additionally, it has more power and is better equipped to do other tasks. For example, because it has a 4th axis, I am using it to make parts for my 
                automatic self-storage concept.
