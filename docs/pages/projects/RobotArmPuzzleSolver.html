                    ## A fun playground
                    ***
                    ### Motivation
                    I have always loved seeing automation technologies in action and this was just a fun little project
                    where I can continue to build
                    that love for it. The intention is to have robot arm play a puzzle game of stacking cyliners of the
                    same color on top of each other.
                    It is kind of like Hanois tower but not quite at the same time. I would urge you to take a look at
                    this video to see my inspiration:

                    ### The Concept
                    My thought process was to take a six axis robot arm and have it scoop the circles off of each peg to
                    move them to the others.

                    To do that I first had to make an arm!

                    ### The Robot Arm
                    I started by assembling a six-axis arm from Annin robotics. This arm was a project of its own and
                    there might be a page on that coming soon!

                    <img src="/portfolio/images/RobotArmConstruction.jpg" , alt="ring" , class="image_center">
                    Robot Arm
                </div>
                <md-block>
                    ### The game pieces
                    After completing the robot arm, I then had to figure out how to manipulate the game pieces for
                    actually playing the game. I started by first using Onshape
                    to design a bracket to hold the disks with the robot arm
                </md-block>
                <div class="text-center">
                    <img src="/portfolio/images/ringHolder.png" , alt="ringHolder" , class="image_center">
                    Ring Holder
                </div>
                <md-block>

                    Following the design of the holder, I printed it out and it was a perfect fit on the robot arm!
                </md-block>
                <div class="text-center">
                    <img src="/portfolio/images/emptyRingHolder.jpg" , alt="ringHolderOnArm" , class="image_center">
                    Ring Holder
                </div>
                <md-block>
                    Naturally, the ring holder needed to hold something! Following the design and printing of the ring
                    holder, I deigned a simple ring that has a groove in the bottom so that they
                    can be manipulated with the robot arm!
                </md-block>
                <div class="text-center">
                    <img src="/portfolio/images/ring.png" , alt="ring" , class="image_center">
                    Ring
                </div>
                <md-block>
                    After some more fun in Onshape, I was able to print a ring that nested perfectly in the groove on
                    the holder. Additionally, there is a short cavity on the top that allows the rings to stack on top
                    of each other!
                </md-block>
                <div class="text-center">
                    <img src="/portfolio/images/ringBeingHeld.jpg" , alt="ringBeingHeld" , class="image_center">
                    Ring
                </div>
                <md-block>
                    Next up I need to design the pegs for the game and work on the algorithm for sorting the rings into
                    their apropriate colors. I feel like this could be a really cool application of the A* algorithm but
                    that is still to come!
                </md-block>
