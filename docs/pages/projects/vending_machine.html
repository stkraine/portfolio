                    ## My Vending Machine
                    ***
                    This was a fun journey that I had when I was in high school. I worked at a small warehouse that specialized in selling tools
                    . This job was in a small building that didn't have any vending services because there wasn't enough demand for management to invest the time. 
                    After hearing from a lot of my co-workers about how nice it would be to have a vending machine, I found that a used vending machine wasn't too terribly expensive.

                    I decided to buy a single machine and put it into the warehouse. This turned into a small source of income that I ran for the remainder of my time in high school before selling the 
                    machine after I graduated. All in all, it was a great experience for me to build up my management skills and learn about running a business.
