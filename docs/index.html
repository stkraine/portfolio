                        Before I even begin, I want to say that I am NOT a web developer, and I am trying to make this
                        with as few helpers as I can. More
                        specifically, I am
                        trying to keep everything within html, css, javascript, and markdown. That being said, if there
                        is
                        anything wrong with this website
                        (formatting, errata in material, etc.), please file an issue here!

                        I do encourage you to also put topics that you think I should explore and write about there as
                        well.
                        Please add the `explore` tag onto that issue, and I will try to look into it! Thanks!

                    Hello, and welcome to my corner of the digital world! I'm Steven, a passionate enthusiast
                    in the fields of robotics and machine learning. If you're curious about the mind behind this page,
                    you've come to the right place. Allow me to share a little about myself, my interests, and some of
                    the exciting projects I've had the privilege to work on.

                    ## My Passion for Robotics and ML
                    Since I was a wee lad, I was always facinated by the technology around me, I spent a lot of time
                    working
                    with my dad around the house and loved using all his tools. One of my earliest memories was sitting
                    on the shop floor
                    pounding nail after nail into a scrap 2x4 with a hammer.

                    From that point on, I started to get involved in Cub Scouts and Robotics. Building pinewood derby
                    cars and little Lego robots that went to competitions fueled my desire to build things and make fun
                    gadgets. This continued into middle school where the robotics team I was on exposed me to the
                    software side
                    of technology. As the robots I was working on got bigger and bigger, the software that I made got
                    more and more
                    complex too. In high school, the robots that I was working became taller than me and solved fun
                    problems within
                    the F.I.R.S.T. programs set of challenges. This passion propelled me into the lead programmer role
                    and helped drive our team to our first
                    competition win and to compete at the world championship multiple years in a row. Little did I know
                    the computer vision and path planning algorithms in high
                    school would lead to
                    so much more!

                    I am now finishing my education at the University of Cincinnati for computer engineering and working
                    on a masters in AI.
                    Fortunately, my passion for robotics has started to turn into a career! College has taught me that
                    there is so
                    much that I do not know yet and has shown me a better way to learn.

                    One thing that I have been exposed to in college is AI. I have fallen in love with AI and its
                    connection to the physical
                    world. A lot of my past internships have been assisting with computer vision algorithm development,
                    working in the parcel handling
                    industry and then on to the self-driving industry as a localization engineer. Finally, I did an
                    internship within a computer
                    vision team working with the defense industry.

                    These work experiences have helped me to become a more well rounded engineer and shown me all the
                    areas that I must
                    continue to grow in. I look forward to the work that will come my way and can't wait to solve the
                    next problem!

                    ## Other interests and hobbies
                    Outside of work and school, I spend a lot of my free time pursuing a plethora of hobbies:
                    ### The great outdoors
                    After I got my eagle scout rank in Boy Scouts, I continued to enjoy hiking and camping with my
                    friends. I have been as far as Utah for
                    Zion national park, but also really enjoy Red River Gorge as well. I especially like to drag my
                    friends along to some of the sights and
                    enjoy getting lost in the woods.

                    Trip to Red River Gorge
                </div>
                <md-block>

                    ### House work
                    As a pathological DIYer, I spend a lot of time working on my house. My carepentry skills have
                    advanced from when I was hammering nails into
                    a single piece of wood when I was younger to where I am now installing flooring, painting everything
                    under the sun, and constructing built-ins
                    for extra seating and storage.

                    ### Cooking
                    Experimenting in the kitchen has become a bit of a creative outlet for me and cooking has turned
                    into a past time of mine
                    especially since I have started college. Not everything turns out that good, but I am always willing
                    to try something new!
                    This is a big upgrade from not trying anything when I was a kid (I was a no-greens kid). Now I am
                    doing a self-proclaimed
                    "tour of the world" where I am experimenting with different cuisines across the world (currently
                    indian is my favorite)

                </div>
                <md-block>
                    ### Running
                    To burn all the calories from my cooking, I will go for some casual jogs around town. This hobby
                    started in High school with cross-country and
                    has turned into a way for me to stay healthy and active to hopefully live to be 100! I just
                    completed my first marathon this past spring and am looking
                    to continue developing as a runner and keep improving!

                    ## Thank you!
                    Thank you for taking the time to get to know me better. I'm on an exciting journey filled with
                    innovation, learning, and the pursuit of a deeper understanding of the world. If you share my
                    passion for robotics, machine learning, or any of my hobbies, I'd love to connect and exchange
                    ideas. Together, we can explore the endless possibilities that await us in the world of technology
                    and beyond. I encourage you to take a look around at some of my projects and other parts of this
                    site!
                    Feel free to reach out; I look forward to connecting with you!
